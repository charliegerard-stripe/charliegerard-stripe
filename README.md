# Hello there! 👋

I'm Charlie Gerard, a developer advocate at Stripe, [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts) in Web Technologies, author of a [book about TensorFlow.js](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Machine-Learning-JavaScript-TensorFlow-js/dp/1484264177) and overall, a self-proclaimed creative technologist 🎨.👩🏻‍💻.

I absolutely love tinkering with new technologies and exploring how I can push the boundaries of what is possible on the web.
I mainly use JavaScript, but I've also worked with Ruby, Python, and a bit of C++ in the past.

I build a lot of side projects related to human-computer interaction so, if you're interested, feel free to [check them out on my website](https://charliegerard.dev/).
